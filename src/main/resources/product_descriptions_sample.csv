100130,"TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Bait Stakes attract and kill all common household ants, including Argentine ants, ghost ants, cornfield ants, pavement ants, acrobat ants, white footed ants, little black ants, odorous house ants and other sweet eating ants. To kill the ants you see and the ants you don't, simply place the pre-filled liquid bait stakes outdoors in areas where ants are observed.  Ants typically follow defined trails from the nest to food or water.  Placing the outdoor stakes close to these trails will improve control. While the active ingredient in TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Bait Stakes will ultimately kill the worker ant, it works slowly to allow worker ants to consume the product and survive long enough to carry the liquid back to the nest and deliver a dose to the rest of the colony. The key to obtaining effective control is to monitor the placements and ensure there is always a fresh supply of TERRO. Depending on the size of the infestation, complete control may take up to two weeks. The patented TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Bait Stakes feature reinforced stake ridges that provide increased strength when placed in the ground. A see-through window makes it easy to monitor the bait level so you know when it's time to replace the stake. The tiered bait pack increases bait consumption and reduces waste. Along with these features, the liquid ant bait inside the stake offers ants both a food and water source.Kills ants outside before they get insidePre-filled bait stations are ready-to-useContains boraxKills the ants you see and the ants you don'tWeatherproof station protects the bait from the elements, prevents it from drying out"

Plus get the air cleaning benefits of the ionic air purifier. The remote control allows you to easily change settings. The Air Cooler works by endothermic reaction (a reaction that consumes heat), so this evaporative Air Cooler sucks air through a wick saturated with water. As the air flows through the wick, some of the water evaporates into the air, consuming the heat that was in the air. An air stream is then blown out the front of the unit and is considerably cooler than the current room temperature. This is not an air conditioner and therefore uses much less energy.

100570,"This Evaporative Air Cooler, Humidifier, and Fan is versatile, lightweight and economical. The Cooler easily rolls from room to room for use anywhere in your house or office. This Air Cooler shoots a stream of air with oscillating louvers, to evenly distribute refreshing cool air. Can also be used as a fan or humidifier if temperature is not an issue. The remote control allows you to easily change settings. The Air Cooler works by endothermic reaction (a reaction that consumes heat), so this evaporative Air Cooler sucks air through a wick saturated with water. As the air flows through the wick, some of the water evaporates into the air, consuming the heat that was in the air. An air stream is then blown out the front of the unit and is considerably cooler than the current room temperature. This is not an air conditioner and therefore uses much less energy. Note: This unit is NOT an air conditioner and does not have a compressor inside - air coolers will not lower a room's ambient temperature. Air coolers are designed for spot cooling. This unit is best used in dry climates or open spaces. Leave window/door open to limit the rise of humidity and for better air ventilation in the room.

223697,"Not all greenhouses are built the same and the Monticello line of greenhouses by Riverstone Industries proves this to be true. The Monticello is applying good old American ingenuity to make the best product for our customers and help to elevate the industry standards of all greenhouses. Constructed from the highest quality extruded aluminum (US grade - not the thinner and more brittle foreign aluminum) and coated as not to discolor over the years (guaranteed to contain 0.0% lead), our greenhouse uses on average more than 40 lbs. more aluminum than the average imported greenhouse. Why is this important. The weaker the framework the less snow the greenhouse can hold in the winter time before collapsing on itself also the easier it will be get damages in wind. While most hobby greenhouses on the market us less expensive thinner walls and roofing materials (the crystal clear walls are as thin as 0.2 mm), the Monticello uses professional grade 8 mm twin wall polycarbonate. This is the same thickness as used in the commercial greenhouses. The twin wall polycarbonate acts as a double pain window keeping cooler air in during warm months and insulating the greenhouse from cold air in the wintertime. This not only makes the Monticello more efficient to grow in for a longer period of time than other greenhouses but it also adds to the efficiency of growing, cutting down electric bills for those who choose to grow year round.Heavy duty extruded aluminum frame construction finished in natural anodized aluminum for long lifeHigh impact, UV stable 8 mm commercial grade twin wall polycarbonate walls and roof construction480 cu. ft. of space, plenty of space to grow your plants and vegetablesThrough a combination of using superior materials that are more rigid and creating interchangeable parts in our design the Monticello takes the average gardener 6-8 hours to assemble the 8 ft. x 8 ft. greenhouse while using much fewer parts, this does not include the base prep work needed, which includes leveling the groundAutomatic opener roof vent (2 ft. x 2 ft.) opens and closes based on interior temperature to help prevent plant wilting and dry outIntegrated flush base design allows for lower than normal door thresholdA-frame roof design to optimize heat disbursement along with roof joist supports that double as hanging plant rodsHinged lockable double doorsGreenhouse dimensions: 8.1 ft.

223888,"Comes standard with the Alen T500 HEPA Air Purifier, the Alen HEPA-Pure Filter combines three layers of filter technology to purify and freshen the air in your home. Polluted air first passes through Alen's washable Pre-Filter to capture large particles, extending the life of the filter. In the second layer, air moves through a unique, electrostatically charged HEPA type material that attracts and captures dust and pollen. Over time, the HEPA-Pure Filter becomes overloaded with particles, decreasing its filtration performance. We recommend replacing your filter every 6 months for severe concerns or when running your air purifier 24/7. Replace your filter every 12 months for light concerns or when running the air purifier only as needed. Rinse or lightly vacuum the removable black Alen Pre-Filter as soon as it develops a layer of visible particles. Allow it to completely dry before replacing. Washing or vacuuming the white HEPA type material will damage the fibers and is not recommended.Creates an allergy and asthma friendly environment by removing dust, pet dander, mold spores and pollen from the airHelps maintain a clean household by reducing dustPre-filter layer extends the life of the filterRemoves 95% of allergens down to .3 microns"
